ALAC
====

Apple Lossless Audio Codec with autotools. This repo uses the source
code from http://alac.macosforge.org/ and wrap it around using
autotools and Debian build toolchain.

## Prerequisites, if you want to build it yourself

* git: to clone this repo. Optional if you are using a tarball.
* gcc: to compile stuff.
* g++: to compile stuff.
* autotools: to generate the build files.

## How to build

### Classic GNU

```bash
autoreconf -i -f
./configure
# Or if you want to
# ./configure --enable-example
make
sudo make install
```

### Debian packaging

This method works if:
* You are using a system using dpkg (like Debian, Ubuntu, etc.)
* And you want .deb's.

**I strongly suggest you to know how the Debian packaging works before
  using this method.**

1. You need to have a packaging environment.
  * If you are a maintainer or you know how to package a deb or you have
    a PPA, skip to step 3.
  * If you don't know anything about Debian packaging, go to step 2.
2. Set up packaging environment.
  * Look [here](http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/start.en.html)
    for Debian users and [here](http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/getting-set-up.html)
    for Ubuntu users.
3. Edit debian/changelog.
  * Change my name to your name, and my email to your email.
  * Change raring to whatever your distro codename is.
4. Do:
   ```
   dpkg-buildpackage
   ```
5. The .deb's will be in the parent folder of the source code directory.

### Visual Studio

** The resulting binary might not work. I don't know why. Do this on
   your own risk.**

1. Go to compat.
2. Go to corresponding folder match your VS version.
3. Open up the solution and build it.

<!--
## Binaries

### Personal Packages Archive

If you are too lazy to download the build the sources yourself, and is
using Ubuntu or something like that, you can just install it from my PPA
at Launchpad. (I guess you know how to add a PPA to your system)

-->

## What's included

* libalac, a library for ALAC en-/decoding.
* alacconvert, an example program using libalac to convert wav (in wav
or caf container) to alac (in caf container) or vice versa. It will only
build if you pass `--enable-example` to `configure`.

## Documentation
### `alacconvert`
Look at the man page.

### The library
Either look at the .txt's in the repo or go to 
[Apple's website](http://alac.macosforge.org/).

## Bugs Report

If you found some difficulty building it, open a new issue. Otherwise,
don't bother me. Note that I am not a programmer. So if you have any
patch regarding the sources I'm sorry I can't apply it. But if it is
about the building system, feel free to open a new  pull request or
an issue.

## Versioning scheme

(upstream_major).(upstream_minor)r(upstream_revision)+tg(my_release_number)

The upstream major and minor are both 0 because Apple never made a
release. The upstream revision is 4 because the SVN revision I pulled out
from is 4. My release number is of course my release number. "tg" is my
initials.

## Authors

* debian/&#42;, Makefile.am, &#42;/Makefile.am, alac.pc.in,
alacconvert.1, configure.ac, README.md:
**Tiancheng "Timothy" Gu**

* The rest: **Apple Inc.**

## To-do

* PPA
* `EXTRA_DIST` variable in Makefile.am's
